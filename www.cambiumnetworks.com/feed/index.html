										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Now that spring is coming, it’s time for people to think about being outside more. While they are getting away from it all, people still want to be connected. Many town councils want to attract people, and free Wi-Fi is a great way to build community while helping local businesses. Whether it is the town square, a park or a community sports field, providing <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/wifi/xv2-2t-outdoor-wi-fi-6-access-point/">outdoor Wi-Fi</a> connectivity needs to be easy and efficient.</p>



<p>Most important, it needs to be easy to manage guest access so people visiting have good experience.</p>



<p>There are 3 key considerations in designing and deploying outdoor public Wi-Fi:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>What applications do you need to support?</strong> Along with public access as the main application, consider also security cameras, weather monitoring and door locks. Leveraging the network for multiple use cases is always a good idea. This also plays into the number of APs required to provide the coverage and capacity. An outdoor AP with longer range enables you to cover more ground with fewer APs. This can save money on not only the equipment itself but also the associated cabling and installation labor. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/FPCHQssbgcE">this video of our Wi-Fi 6 outdoor AP connecting at 1 kilometer range</a>.</li><li><strong>How will you backhaul to the Wi-Fi AP?</strong> Chances are good that fiber isn’t already right there in your park. And Wi-Fi mesh simply won’t deliver the performance you need. Our <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/60-ghz-cnwave/">60 GHz cnWave</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> solution delivers gigabit speed fixed wireless backhaul that is more reliable and efficient than trenching cable or fiber to each AP. Also, if you ever plan to deploy video surveillance, our solutions and connect to cameras easily.</li><li><strong>How will you manage the network?</strong> Everyone wants free Wi-Fi, even residents who live next to the park. Usage policy must focus on easily onboarding the intended park visitors while restraining others. Centralized management with the <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnmaestro-essentials/">cnMaestro<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> cloud management system</a> makes it easy to ensure that guests are experiencing great connectivity in all of your outdoor Wi-Fi locations. On one screen, a system admin has full control of multiple networks at their fingertips. Examples include shutting down the Wi-Fi when the park is closed, managing the duration or rate limit per user, or limiting the session renewal frequency. &nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Cambium Networks has provided reliable solutions for Wi-Fi hotspots in community parks and town centers around the world. As a part of the <a href="https://wifi4eu.ec.europa.eu/#/home">European WiFi4EU connectivity initiative</a>, Cambium Networks solutions have been deployed in <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/blog/wifi4eu-in-2020-cambium-networks-has-carried-out-more-than-1000-projects-in-europe/">more than 1,000 municipal projects</a>.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/resource/outdoor-wi-fi-6-provides-end-to-end-connectivity-for-olympic-trials-in-oregon/">Elevate Technology Group connected the McKenzie International Track Meet in Blue River, Oregon</a> to support hundreds of attendees, athletes and staff while also providing a livestream of the event.</li><li><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Case_Study_Nidda_Short-Version_EN.pdf">The city of Nidda in Germany</a> improved the quality of life for citizens and local businesses with Wi-Fi in the city center.</li><li><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/City_of_Independence_Case_Study_on_Expanding_Public_Wifi_1622838513-1.pdf">The city of Independence, Oregon</a> delivers public Wi-Fi internet access to people in a park, public garden and library on a limited budget.</li><li><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/blog/everest-link-cambium-bring-extreme-internet-everest/">Everest Link</a> provides connectivity in the most daunting areas at the very top of the world, bringing communications for climbing expeditions, community projects, and education to northeastern Nepal.</li></ul>



<p>Providing community hotspots should be as easy as – a walk in the park. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Network operators can now optimize performance and revenue with their own heatmap plans for fixed wireless coverage.</em></p>



<p><strong>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill.,</strong> March 3, 2022 –<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/"> </a><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/">Cambium Networks</a> (NASDAQ: CMBM), a leading global provider of wireless networking solutions, today announced the release of <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnheat/">cnHeat 2.0 network planning subscription service</a>. With cnHeat 2.0 network operators can now predict the results of their RF plans in a timely manner. The high-resolution heatmapping service uses LiDAR data to optimize coverage, performance, and customer satisfaction while minimizing both OPEX and CAPEX. cnHeat is built upon Cambium Networks’ expertise in fixed wireless Radio Frequency (RF) planning, propagation and modeling integrated with GIS data down to one-meter precision. Thousands of cnHeat models have been made since cnHeat was launched in 2019. With cnHeat 2.0, network designers now plan their own sites and no longer need to request designs and wait days for results to be processed. The system optimizes fixed wireless planning for <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/60-ghz-cnwave/">60 GHz</a> installations in addition to <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/point-to-multipoint-fixed-wireless-broadband/">2.4 GHz, 3 GHz (including CBRS), 5 GHz</a> and <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/cnwave/28-ghz-cnwave-customer-premises-equipment/">28 GHz</a> equipment.</p>



<p>“We use cnHeat 2.0 to not only plan our deployments and optimize field installations for our technicians, but also determine our tower installations and configurations,” said Jennifer Long, Internet Services Manager, <a href="https://www.gvec.org/">Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperative (GVEC)</a>. “cnHeat cuts the installation time by telling technicians exactly where on the house to place equipment. Customers are pleased with the quality and speed of our installations.” GVEC offers their customers electric, internet and beyond-the-meter services for residential and commercial customers in Texas. View <a href="https://youtu.be/OITZ4lCWN3s">this video</a> to see how GVEC optimizes customer satisfaction and installation efficiency.</p>



<p>“cnHeat 2.0 provides detailed coverage information that enables operators to tune each site to optimize coverage and performance,” said Dan Sullivan, director of product management, Cambium Networks. “With this information, technicians are dispatched to a site to make exact adjustments with known benefits.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We all dream of the days when our children learn through exciting, immersive experiences, curated and guided by their teachers, regardless of socio-economic status.  This reality is closer than you might think thanks to the new 6 GHz spectrum made accessible by Wi-Fi 6E based networks.</p>



<p>So how does Wi-Fi 6E fit into this? First of all, let’s start with what Wi-Fi 6E is. The most important aspect of this new flavor of Wi-Fi is that it adds support for the 6 GHz band. This expands the available spectrum for Wi-Fi by two to three times (results differ by country). This represents by far the largest expansion of capacity for Wi-Fi in its 25-year history and means there is a lot more space available for Wi-Fi to support reliable, congestion-free connections. There are other enhancements in Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, including improvements in high-density Wi-Fi client support and reduced traffic latency. These types of improvements are very relevant for education where high densities of students and devices require connectivity in classrooms, auditoriums, libraries, sports venues and more for critical applications.</p>



<p>Does existing, pre-Wi-Fi 6E technology have sufficient capacity and capability to support these use cases in education today? For the vast majority of scenarios today, the answer is yes. Most use cases are well-supported with existing Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 technologies available today. However, the trends around technology dependency and usage requirements are ever on an upward trend in education as new applications are incorporated into curriculum. Some examples include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Online testing and assessments, </strong>which are of significant importance to schools. When they are being run, the Wi-Fi network must be functioning flawlessly and cannot be the reason why a test cannot be administered or that a student fails.</li><li><strong>Video collaboration</strong> applications such as Zoom, Meet and Teams supporting remote and hybrid learning. While these applications can create capacity issues on some school networks, the bigger issue is ensuring reliable service given these applications are sensitive to network quality parameters such as latency, jitter and packet loss.</li><li><strong>High-bandwidth applications</strong> such as augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), which will see increased usage over time and bring even more stringent requirements to wireless networks. While the requirements for these types of applications would have been impossible over wireless years ago, advancements in Wi-Fi technology over the last few generations have enabled entirely new use cases.</li></ul>



<p>Wi-Fi 6E sets the groundwork for improving wireless network quality and enabling these types of critical applications now and in the future. While many of these challenges and new requirements may not be directly impacting schools today, they inevitably will at some point. For purchase decisions being made today or in the near future, should Wi-Fi 6E be considered given the benefits it brings? A few points to consider:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Network lifespan</strong> – The average life of a Wi-Fi network is about five years. There is no doubt that Wi-Fi 6E will become significantly more pervasive in usage during this timeframe.</li><li><strong>Client availability</strong> – While there are not many Wi-Fi 6E clients in use today, they have been available since the beginning of 2021. The number of total shipments globally is in the hundreds of millions. There are very likely Wi-Fi-6E-capable clients on your network today. A number of mobile phones and some laptops support Wi-Fi 6E as of the beginning of 2022 with more coming to market over time.</li><li><strong>Economics</strong> – When new technology becomes available, it may come at a premium price. Price is typically a very important consideration in education, so investment in Wi-Fi 6E must be viewed in light of what benefits it will deliver relative to other solutions on the market.</li></ul>



<p>Given this background, how are Cambium Networks’ Wi-Fi 6E solutions applicable to the needs of the educational market–today and tomorrow?</p>



<ul><li><strong>Better Wi-Fi 6 now</strong> – Despite the fact that you may not have many or any Wi-Fi 6E clients on your Wi-Fi network today, Cambium’s Wi-Fi 6E represent a better Wi-Fi access point to support your existing network and clients. With more radios compared to standard APs–three or five radios on Cambium’s <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/wifi/xe3-4-wi-fi-6e-access-point/">XE3-4</a> and <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/wifi/xe5-8-wi-fi-6e-access-point/">XE5-8</a> AP models respectively vs. two radios on a typical Wi-Fi 6 AP–you have greater capacity and flexibility supporting existing Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 clients on your network today. The new APs also leverage the latest, greatest processor and radio chipsets. You are buying ahead in the technology cycle and will be able to take advantage of better performance and features/functionality with the new solutions even without enabling the 6 GHz band.</li><li><strong>Migrate when ready</strong> – The XE-series APs support software-defined radios, meaning that select radios on the APs can be configured to run either in Wi-Fi 6 5 GHz or Wi-Fi 6E 6 GHz mode. You can configure these APs as Wi-Fi 6 devices today and reprogram radios to operate in 6 GHz when those devices start to show up on the network in larger numbers. Cambium’s <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnmaestro-essentials/">cnMaestro</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/xms-cloud/">XMS-Cloud</a> will automatically monitor the Wi-Fi network and recommend when you should enable 6 GHz. This type of flexibility is key when new technology is introduced – compatibility with existing requirements while providing a roadmap to the future when you are ready. The benefits of this include investment protection and system longevity.</li><li><strong>Optimized high density</strong> – The Cambium XE5-8 AP is completely unique in the industry with five Wi-Fi radios capable of supporting hundreds of devices with a single AP (absolute maximum is 2,500). For locations where high-density Wi-Fi usage is seen, e.g., auditoriums, gymnasiums, student centers, sports arenas, libraries, cafeterias, etc., the XE5-8 is ideal as one AP can replace three to four traditional two-radio APs. This reduces equipment costs, cable runs, installation costs, power consumption and maintenance costs, collectively reducing the total cost of ownership by a significant amount.</li><li><strong>Future proof without a premium</strong> – A key criterion for many schools considering a new Wi-Fi infrastructure investment is cost. Cambium’s Wi-Fi 6E solutions effectively bring this new technology to the market without a cost premium compared to previous Wi-Fi generations. With the benefits of more radios per AP and software-defined radios, the new XE-series APs can replace multiple traditional APs depending on the deployment scenario. This can provide significant cost savings and actually lowers total system costs compared to previous-generation solutions.</li></ul>



<p>The introduction of Wi-Fi 6E represents a watershed moment for Wi-Fi. The technological advances it provides together with true economic advantages make a compelling combination for educational institutions to consider when investing in their networks for the future.

<p><strong><em>Technical Tips from Road Warriors</em></strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/60-ghz-cnwave/">802.11ay standard</a> distributed meshing technology is a key functionality of <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/60-ghz-cnwave/">60 GHz cnWave</a> fixed wireless solutions from Cambium Networks. If not installed and powered correctly, the system will not work. Understanding how to properly configure power to the nodes is the key to getting right. In many cases, the solution is easy.</p>



<p>When designing a mesh network, <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/cnwave/60-ghz-cnwave-v5000/">V5000 distribution node (DN)</a> modules are commonly interconnected with <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/cnwave/60-ghz-cnwave-v3000/">V3000 client nodes (CN)</a> to provide greater distance between DNs or to connect to a POP located up to one mile away. In some of these cases, the power may be incorrectly connected to a V5000 directly from a V3000 AUX port. When configured this way, the V5000 node powers up but fails to get its configuration. This is the case because it needs a full 35 watts of power, which is more than the maximum 30 watts that the V3000 can supply from the onboard AUX port.</p>



<p>The solution for this is simple. Design the installation of co-located nodes to feed the V3000 client node from the V5000 distribution node AUX port, which can easily supply the power for the V3000. The system will come up fine.</p>



<p>If you want to utilize more than 1 Gbps from that AUX port, a DAC cable can connect the V3000 and V5000 to provide multi-gigabit Ethernet.</p>

<p><em>Guests on the North Sea beach campsite have the freedom to enjoy the outdoors while staying connected to family, friends, school and work.</em></p>



<p><strong>DORNUMERSIEL, GERMANY &amp; ROLLING MEADOWS, IL,</strong> February 7, 2022 –<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com"> </a><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com">Cambium Networks</a> (NASDAQ: CMBM), a leading global provider of wireless networking solutions, today announced that the<a href="https://www.dornum.de/unterkuenfte-camping/campingurlaub-in-dornumersiel/campingplatz-am-nordseestrand"> </a><a href="https://www.dornum.de/unterkuenfte-camping/campingurlaub-in-dornumersiel/campingplatz-am-nordseestrand">campsite on the North Sea beach in Dornumersiel</a> is using Cambium Networks’ wireless fabric portfolio of solutions to enable greater network performance and meet higher guest requirements. Previously composed of Wi-Fi access points (AP) connected via 5 GHz fixed wireless equipment, the campsite’s network now features <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/60-ghz-cnwave/">60 GHz cnWave</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> millimeter wave wireless technology which serves as the backhaul for<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/enterprise-wi-fi-switching/"> </a><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/enterprise-wi-fi-switching/">cnPilot<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Wi-Fi connectivity</a> for guests. The new network is managed with the <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnmaestro-essentials/">cnMaestro<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> wireless network manager</a> to provide end-to-end network control.</p>



<p>IT service provider <a href="https://www.1top.it/">1top.IT</a> updated the network equipment to support guests with better Wi-Fi access onsite. 1top.IT installed and commissioned a <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/pmp-distribution/60-ghz-cnwave-v5000/">60 GHz cnWave V5000 distribution node (DN)</a> and <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/pmp-distribution/60-ghz-cnwave-v1000/">60 GHz cnWave v1000 client nodes (CN)</a> in a point-to-multipoint setup for a fixed wireless broadband connection. To support Wi-Fi connectivity, the service provider set up <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/wifi/">cnPilot e700, e510, e501S and e502S Wi-Fi APs</a>. A total of 18 outdoor Wi-Fi APs and four indoor Wi-Fi APs are in place for wireless local area network (WLAN) coverage.</p>



<p>“Many of our guests want to use streaming platforms or work from their laptops while on vacation. With our previous system, it was simply not possible to meet these requirements,” says Rolf Kopper, managing director at <a href="https://www.dornum.de/">Tourismus GmbH Gemeinde Dornum</a>. “The WLAN connection is absolutely stable even when the campsite is at full capacity.”</p>



<p>The distributed network infrastructure utilizes Cambium Networks’<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/millimeter-wave/"> </a><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/millimeter-wave/">60 GHz cnWave fixed wireless</a> broadband equipment to extend fiber capacity over the air. 60 GHz frequencies are often expected to have issues with precipitation and fog due to its shorter radio waves. However, mesh networks can reroute signals so that the connection remains available and reliable. According to 1top.IT, there have been no significant issues with rain or fog at the campsite.</p>



<p>The campsite is using the high-bandwidth solution to accommodate a high number of potentially simultaneous users and hundreds of devices. Guests receive a personal WLAN code in the form of a printed voucher and are able to surf the internet according to their needs.</p>



<p>“Since we switched to the Cambium Networks WLAN system, our guest ratings have improved greatly in terms of WLAN. We have also switched to the cnMaestro system for administration. For our staff, the Cambium network and management tool enables them to work faster and more efficiently. The improved WLAN infrastructure has a positive impact all around for everyone involved,” says Kopper.</p>



<p>Within two working days, 1top.IT was able to support 100 permanent camper sites, 200 pitches for caravans and mobile homes, 60 tent pitches, sanitary facilities and the registration area. 1top.IT monitors and manages the network through<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnmaestro-essentials/"> </a><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnmaestro-essentials/">cnMaestro</a>, Cambium Networks’ wireless network manager offering full network visibility and zero-touch provisioning. Up to four additional DNs or 30 CNs can be connected to the cnWave V5000 DN, enabling an easy and inexpensive option to extend the network in the future.</p>

<p>Do Gigabit speeds to residences require fiber? Not anymore.</p>



<p>Avoid the time and cost of trenching and getting right of way and satisfy the end customer using Fixed Wireless. Deliver Gigabit download and high-speed symmetrical services that satisfy the need for work from home videoconferencing and streaming gaming and entertainment – and get to those customers first.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="171" src="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/Speedtest.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56108" srcset="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/Speedtest.jpg 940w, https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/Speedtest-500x91.jpg 500w, https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/Speedtest-768x140.jpg 768w, https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/Speedtest-380x69.jpg 380w, https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/Speedtest-760x138.jpg 760w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><figcaption>Multi-Gigabit Speed Delivered Over 60 GHz Fixed Wireless</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Multi-Gigabit Wireless Technology in a Mesh Architecture</strong></p>



<p>Fixed Wireless in the 60 GHz frequency band provides a highly reliable and efficient platform that can be deployed at a fraction of the time and cost of trenching fiber. Leveraging the <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/60-ghz-cnwave/">802.11ay standard</a>, efficient meshing technology, distributed network infrastructure, beam steering, software defined radios and centralized cloud management, <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/60-ghz-cnwave/">60 GHz cnWave</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> delivers performance that was previously only associated with fiber.</p>



<p>Another distinct advantage of the fixed wireless distributed architecture is the resilience, automatic failure detection and repair. Should a link go down the system will automatically reroute traffic through the next best path to provide continuity to the subscriber. This is achieved through the use of Distribution Node (DN&#8217;s) and Multiple Point of Presences (PoPs).</p>



<p>60 GHz cnWave is easy to add to existing networks based on layer 2 and IPv4 protocols while behind the scenes it takes advantage of the latest layer 3 routing and IPv6 for scalability and resiliency today.</p>



<p>Find out more about Gig speed fixed <a href="https://youtu.be/V0tPKSPSO1c">wireless in this video</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Planning Tools Make It Easy</strong></p>



<p>Not familiar with fixed wireless? Software planning tools optimize design and hence reduce system cost while maximizing revenue.&nbsp; Tools based on LiDAR data provide the precision to accurately budget equipment needed to satisfy any Fixed Wireless deployment and then to accurately position DNs for robust resilience of the DN backbone and the ability to provide service to all customer buildings. <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnheat/">cnHeat</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> generates predictions to one-meter precision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our lives in many ways, shuttering physical workplaces and forcing educational institutions to pivot to remote learning. As part of their mandate of community support, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phillyjcc.com/">Kaiserman Jewish Community Center</a>&nbsp;of Wynnewood, PA,&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;temporarily&nbsp;convert their dance studios, art rooms, and gyms into remote classrooms so&nbsp;working&nbsp;parents would have a safe place to leave their children during the&nbsp;day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Kaiserman JCC’s original&nbsp;Wi-Fi&nbsp;solution hadn’t been designed to handle high-bandwidth activities and offered only spotty connectivity and poor coverage. As such, significant improvements were required so it could meet students’ remote learning needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure their network would be ready in time for the new school year, the Kaiserman JCC board turned to <a href="https://integratingwifi.com/">WiFi Integrators for Innovation</a> for assistance. The community center needed a fast and reliable network and could be designed, deployed, and tested before they began to welcome students. They also needed a more effective way to manage their access points (APs), address their poorly installed and overloaded switches, and access ongoing support and troubleshooting assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wi-Fi&nbsp;Integrators for Innovation designed the community center’s network using Cambium Networks products, including adding a small <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/">Cambium Networks</a> router and additional indoor APs. Cambium Networks has long been known for their high-quality products and customer-focused approach to business, values that&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;Integrators for Innovation shares. Cambium Networks was also selected because they would not require cloud management or licensing fees, allowing the Kaiserman JCC to enjoy fast, reliable, and affordable connectivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new network was installed and fully operational in just over a day. After installing, testing, and configuring the networking equipment,&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;Integrators for Innovation set up separate&nbsp;Wi-Fi&nbsp;networks for staff, students, and guests to help ensure both high-quality connectivity and improved security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new network can comfortably support&nbsp;many&nbsp;remote students simultaneously, ensuring community center students have the tools they need to succeed and a safe, supervised learning environment while providing parents with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With lingering effects of the COVID pandemic, 2021 was a difficult year. <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/blog/cambium-networks-2021-predictions-covid-has-accelerated-the-demand-for-bandwidth-and-significant-changes-are-here-to-stay/">We correctly predicted</a> that remote work was not going away, and that people would migrate out of the congested city centers. We also predicted a growth in private broadband networks. On the technology front, we foresaw that millimeter wave technology would have an impact on city centers, which is starting to appear. Our miss was that spectrum sharing as in the case of CBRS outside of the USA did not happen as soon as we had stated.</p>



<p>2022 will see continued demand for high performance wireless broadband driving the deployment of hybrid wireless/wired networks for service provider and enterprise private networks. Adoption of Wi-Fi 6 technology and the opening up of the 6 GHz frequency bands will drive rapid adoption. Specifically:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Hybrid networks (combination of fixed wireless and wired) will become the mainstream network architecture</strong>, regardless of funding model – not just in rural areas but in suburban and urban as well. It’s simply a matter of economics (when it can be wireless, it will be wireless) and time to deployment (we can’t wait years for wired networks).</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi 6 adoption will grow exponentially</strong>, pushed by the shortages in Wi-Fi 5 chipsets, and fueled by iPhone 12/13 adoption. Also, most Wi-Fi 5 based access points will be discontinued (End of Life announced) during 2022. Intelligent and connected home devices will continue to proliferate, continuing to drive demand for bandwidth.</li><li><strong>National, state and local government connectivity will grow</strong>. Smart city / safe city applications will remain front and center for every municipal government. Healthcare applications will continue to propel the need for increased bandwidth. As such, the challenging terrain will drive many network extensions to be wireless.</li><li><strong>Adoption of 6 GHz will be fast</strong> with brief Proof of Concept (PoC) trials which are well underway.</li><li><strong>Millimeter wave adoption will be rapid</strong> as network operators have more options in 60 GHz and 5G Fixed 28 GHz frequency bands. For both service providers and enterprises, hybrid networks of 5G, fiber, fixed 5G, and fixed wireless technologies will provide increased end user capacity and reliability while delivering a solid business case.</li></ol>



<p>In 2022, we’ll continue to experience some of the most profound changes we saw in the past year, including new spectrum allocations and supply chain challenges. There will also be continued increasing demand for high-speed connectivity at home to meet the needs of remote work, distance learning, better entertainment and fulfilling the dream of a smarter home. But one thing remains true. Technology innovation in the wireless space will continue to accelerate in 2022 to bring more affordable high-speed internet to more locations to improve communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heroes extend connectivity to solve problems. Connectivity is of no value when it is not available. While the technology exists, leaders need to see the gaps, develop a plan to solve the connectivity challenge, and collaborate with others to implement the solution. Great leaders make this process smooth for all parties involved – and they are frequently called upon to “do it again.”</p>



<p>This quarter, both of our heroes led teams to extend Wi-Fi coverage with fixed wireless infrastructure. Whether Wi-Fi is needed for residential applications in multi-dwelling units (MDU) or providing coverage in the center of a major city, fixed wireless connectivity is an efficient solution to provide the coverage and capacity exactly where it is needed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>With optimism at 81 percent, global study showcases increased confidence in ability to grow their business and provide customers with higher broadband performance at lower costs</em></p>



<p><strong>ROLLING MEADOWS, IL.,</strong> Nov. 30, 2021 –<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/"> </a>&nbsp;Despite the unprecedented challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty in the economic climate, optimism among wireless broadband service providers is at a record high, according to a survey released today by <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/">Cambium Networks</a> (NASDAQ: CMBM), a leading global provider of wireless networking solutions. For the first time, more than four out of every five wireless broadband service providers (81%) report that they are either more or equally optimistic about the future, up from 71% in 2020 and 61% in 2019.</p>



<p>The global study, Cambium Networks’ fifth annual survey, was conducted between July and August 2021 and gathered insights from providers of high-speed connectivity across 23 countries. The detailed survey explored a range of topics to assess service providers’ ability to meet increased customer demand for video, data, voice, and IT services to remain competitive.</p>



<p>The details of the survey show that wireless broadband service providers are fundamentally confident in their ability to acquire and retain satisfied business and residential customers by offering reliable service at reasonable prices, comfortable being early adopters of wireless technology; and able to make the most of new spectrum &#8211; including <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/cbrs/">Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)</a> in the United States and <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/millimeter-wave/">60 GHz frequency band</a> globally.</p>



<p>“Wireless service providers remain resilient, with an unwavering ability to rapidly adapt to changes in demand and technology and strong commitment to satisfy their customers by providing reliable service at competitive prices,” said Scott Imhoff, senior&nbsp;vice president of product management at Cambium Networks. “By capitalizing on new opportunities in suburban and rural areas, while still serving their satisfied base in rural areas, they continue to drive the industry forward and create stronger, more connected communities.”</p>



<p>While wireless broadband service providers historically excel in rural residential services, the study showed that these operators are becoming equally adept at providing connectivity in urban and suburban applications, especially with 28 and 60 GHz millimeter wave technology trials and early deployments coming online in 2021. While 44% provide coverage in rural areas, coverage in urban areas climbed from 15% to 18%. Nearly a quarter (24%) provide services across an even split of urban, suburban and rural communities.</p>



<p>The planned 2022 availability of new 6 GHz spectrum also is seen as an exciting opportunity for expansion, with all respondents reporting that they are developing plans to capitalize on it to better meet the needs of increasing demand for connectivity.</p>



<p>In addition, wireless broadband service providers continue to expand their service offerings to grow their business, with 22% adding residential Wi-Fi, 14% adding outdoor hotspots, and 3% now offering mobile services. At the same time, the focus on some service offerings that saw growth in 2020 declined in 2021, including managed Wi-Fi (16%), voice (16%), IT support (12%) and video surveillance (11%).</p>



<p>Among the challenges facing wireless broadband service providers, funding and financing continues to rank highest, with 31% seeing it as an obstacle for growth. RF spectrum availability followed closely (29%).</p>



<p>“As we look ahead to 2022 and 6 GHz frequency bands become available, there will be a rapid and efficient use of RF spectrum,” continued Imhoff. “We expect these service providers to seize this opportunity for growth by offering more turnkey services to enterprise, industrial and municipal markets while extending services for home office applications.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In October of 2011, Cambium Networks separated from Motorola, and we began our journey as an independent company. The people of Cambium Networks are the strongest and most valuable asset we have. We listen to customers, identify opportunities, understand the current and evolving technology and always do our best to deliver communications solutions that just work.</p>



<p>One of our core values is to give back to the community. Not even the COVID pandemic can stop that. To celebrate our 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary, each of our 700 team members was given one day during the month of October as a Day of Giving. Each person could identify a need and give their time and talents to help people in their local community. The pandemic restrictions set some boundaries, but our team members were able to give back. Our more than 10,000 channel partners also joined in the Day of Giving with projects serving their local communities.</p>



<p>We started the month-long anniversary celebration with a mentoring panel for all team members on “Sharing Talent.” We discussed how and when is the best way to give of yourself (as a parent, as a child, as a friend, as a colleague) to do something with no expectation of compensation.</p>



<p>The “giving back” activities are as diverse as the people and the places they live.</p>



<p>Cambium Networks team members donated their Day of Giving to:</p>



<ul><li>Clean a beach in Barcelona, Spain</li><li>Visit and comfort elderly dementia patients in France</li><li>Help an elderly man move to a new home</li><li>Help a high school student in Turkey through the <a href="https://www.cydd.org.tr/">Association for Supporting Contemporary Life</a></li><li>Deliver comfort therapy to three people in Italy</li><li>Volunteer as a mentor for the <a href="https://beaconfoundation.org.au/">Beacon Foundation</a> in Australia, who provide mentoring to school goers from lower socio economic areas and remote regions to help them prepare to enter the workforce</li><li>Donate socks for those undergoing chemotherapy since one of the side effects are cold extremities</li><li>Clean a beach in Florida</li><li>Donate and plant Oak trees at a park</li><li>Donate blood to help people with health issues when blood supplies are low</li><li>Donate to the <a href="https://www.akshayapatra.org/">Akshaya Patra</a> relief operations for children in India</li><li>Donate food and time to the <a href="https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/">Greater Chicago Food Depository</a> to help people in need</li><li>Donate to the <a href="https://www.christiancommunityactiontx.com/">CCA food pantry</a> in Lewisville, Texas</li><li>Preparing and distributing food to a local food pantry each Sunday in October</li><li>Donate to the <a href="https://www.itdrc.org/">Information Technology Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC</a>) to provide connectivity for families and aid agencies in the wake of natural disasters</li><li>Sort donations and making up food boxes for the <a href="https://hitsfoodbank.org/">Homeless in Teignbridge Support (HITS) Foodbank</a> in the UK</li><li>Pack 16,848 meals for <a href="https://www.fmsc.org/">Feed My Starving Children</a> to deliver worldwide</li></ul>



<p>When you give back to the community, you also receive a deep satisfaction of connecting to others. After more than a year of COVID restrictions, many of our team members felt the powerful joy of helping others and improving the communities in which they live.</p>



<p>Cambium Networks’ people make the difference. When faced with challenges, we see the need, assess the alternatives and commit to doing the best that we can. We are glad to share with the communities we live in. That is who we are. With our first 10 years as a foundation, we will continue to do so.</p>

<p><em>One of the largest Fixed Wireless Broadband Deployments in the World Offers Reliable and Affordable Connectivity to Residential, Business and Enterprise Subscribers</em></p>



<p><strong>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill.,</strong> Nov 23, 2021 –<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/"> </a><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/">Cambium Networks</a> (NASDAQ: CMBM), a leading global provider of wireless networking solutions, today announced that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lnet.Ly/">Lnet</a> has deployed <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/epmp/">ePMP<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> fixed wireless broadband</a> technology to connect more than 60,000 residential, business and enterprise customers in Libya. The ePMP network is composed of more than 1,500 Access Points (AP) installed on more than 250 tower locations and serves densely populated urban and suburban locations.</p>



<p>“We are proud to be one of the largest ePMP networks in the world, enabling Lnet to provide excellent quality services at an affordable cost” said Ahmed Kalush, CEO, Lnet. “Customers choose Lnet because we deliver what we promise at a reasonable price with a 24/7 tech support team monitoring the network thanks to <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnmaestro-essentials/">cnMaestro<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> network management</a> capabilities.”</p>



<p>Lnet started their deployment of Cambium Networks’ ePMP equipment in 2015 when they replaced a system that could not scale or perform in noisy RF environments. The Lnet deployments are all in relatively densely populated suburban environments.</p>



<p>To succeed, Lnet had to overcome significant challenges and achieve:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Higher Capacity</strong>: Due to population density the service provider’s towers are located very close to each other with an average distance of 1.5 KM between towers. With <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/epmp/">GPS synchronization and frequency re-use</a>, the ePMP system is able to scale in dense environments, with many APs supporting 120 clients, five times the number possible with the previous solution.</li><li><strong>Superior Interference Tolerance</strong>: Many RF emitters in the urban environment create a high ambient noise level. With ePMP’s <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/epmp/">smart beamforming antennas and intelligent filtering</a>, the system blocks noise from outside the operating spectrum and uses dynamic filtering to block interference from adjacent channels.</li><li><strong>Reduced CAPEX</strong> –ePMP enables Lnet to support a significantly higher number of subscribers per Access Point.&nbsp; With less equipment, fewer towers, and lower maintenance they were able to reduce their costs and win in a competitive market.</li></ol>



<p>“Lnet started out with low cost equipment from another supplier and found that it could not scale when the business grew,” said Martin de la Serna, vice president of sales for Cambium Networks. “The ePMP system offers sophisticated GPS synchronization and smart antennas that provide solid communications in dense and noisy environments. In addition, ePMP does so while reducing the total cost of ownership.”</p>



<p>Network management is easy with the cloud-based &nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/cnmaestro-essentials/">cnMaestro<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> system</a> that provides a unified view of the entire network via the cloud. The solution delivers reliable and secure connectivity for residential users, schools, enterprises, and industrial operations at a low total cost of ownership.</p>



<p>More details on the Lnet deployment are available in <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lnet-Provides-Market-Leading-Services-With-Second-Largest-ePMP-Fixed-Wireless-Network-in-the-World.pdf">this case study</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cambium Networks’ full wireless fabric portfolio of solutions are available through its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/where-to-buy/">global network of partners</a>.</p>



<p><strong>About Lnet</strong><br>Libyan International Company for Technology and Information Technology (LNET) Was established in early 2013, where it started contributing in the development of Libyan internet infrastructure, in a brief amount of time LNET was able to provide services covering a vast geographical area and with the trust and belief of LNET’s customers the company became the largest private internet service provider in Libya in geographical presence and infrastructure size.

<p><strong>MANASSA, CO &amp; ROLLING MEADOWS, IL,</strong> Nov 02, 2021 – <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com">Cambium Networks</a> (NASDAQ: CMBM), a leading global provider of wireless networking solutions, today announced that <a href="https://gojade.org/">Jade Communications</a> is offering multi-gigabit wireless connectivity in the city of Manassa, Colorado, to serve business and residential customers.

All Jade customers in Manassa can receive more than 500 Mbps of bandwidth and up to 2 Gbps.</p>

<p>The distributed network infrastructure utilizes Cambium Networks’<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/millimeter-wave/"> 60 GHz cnWave<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> fixed wireless</a> broadband equipment with Terragraph, a gigabit wireless technology developed by Meta Connectivity to extend fiber capacity over the air.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jade-3-60-GHz-Speed-Test-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-53241" width="235" height="294" srcset="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jade-3-60-GHz-Speed-Test-2.jpg 557w, https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jade-3-60-GHz-Speed-Test-2-400x500.jpg 400w, https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jade-3-60-GHz-Speed-Test-2-144x180.jpg 144w, https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jade-3-60-GHz-Speed-Test-2-288x360.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /><figcaption>Multi- Gigabit Speed from 60 GHz  cnWave</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Historically, we’ve offered our customers 50 and 100 Mbps services with Cambium Networks’ <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/pmp-450/">PMP 450 fixed wireless</a> product line. However, the pandemic has accelerated the pace of innovation,” said Jordan Wehe, Marketing Director of Jade Communications. “Cambium’s cnWave technology is making gigabit access more accessible for the Manassa community.”</p>



<p>With more people working from home, remote education and the addition of smart home devices, Jade Communications needed to provide symmetrical services with higher upstream throughput. Jade Communications, which has 4,500 subscribers, currently has over 65 cnWave units installed and twelve city blocks receiving higher speed symmetrical services.</p>



<p>“The new equipment is so fast; I can’t believe it. I was able to make the changes on my iPad and Kindle effortlessly,” said Ann H., a Jade Communications customer in Manassa. “It was a great experience. We wholeheartedly recommend Jade for internet and Wi-Fi.”</p>



<p>Installation of the service is also fast. Jade is offering next-day gigabit-speed service to all their subscribers and plans to migrate many of their users to the 60 GHz cnWave equipment. This supports the family-oriented Manassa community, which is one of the lowest-income counties in Colorado.</p>



<p>Fixed wireless technology allows Jade to rapidly bring service to their customers without spending thousands of dollars on time-consuming construction for fiber buildouts. For Jade, 60 GHz cnWave significantly reduces the cost to deliver gigabit service when compared to fiber. Because of this, Jade can recoup the cost of installation within three months of onboarding a customer. Jade passes the savings onto their customers; their subscribers can get the bandwidth they need at a price they can afford.</p>



<p>“Fixed wireless broadband using 60 GHz is enabling service providers and cities to deploy cost-effective, high-speed, multi-gigabit fixed wireless connectivity for their users,” said Atul Bhatnagar, president and CEO of Cambium Networks. “We are pleased to recognize Jade’s efforts in delivering multi-gigabit speeds to Manassa, Colorado.”</p>



<p>Cambium Networks’ 60 GHz cnWave fixed wireless technology layers a unique industrial design with automatic beam-steering on top of the latest 802.11ay standard, providing reliable multi-gigabit capacity along with low latency and resilience. The robust network design enables large numbers of network users to enjoy bandwidth-intensive services such as streaming video, video conferencing, social media, audio streaming, voice calling and more.</p>

<p><em>The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation deploys indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi across the museum and Liberty Island</em></p>



<p><strong>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill.,</strong> Oct 27, 2021 –<a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/"> </a><a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/">Cambium Networks</a> (NASDAQ: CMBM), a leading global provider of wireless networking solutions, today announced that <a href="https://www.nps.gov/elis/index.htm">The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Inc</a>. has deployed Cambium Networks’ <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/wifi/">indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi access points</a> to connect the more than 4 million people who visit Liberty Island and the Statue of Liberty Museum each year. The Wi-Fi network provides internet connectivity for both public access and employee access in the museum and around the island.</p>



<p>“The Wi-Fi network provides service for both visitors and staff as cell phone coverage is virtually nonexistent on the island,” said Sherranette Tinapunan, the Foundation’s IT Director. “The previous Wi-Fi system could not handle the daily network traffic generated by users. Today, Foundation employees use the Wi-Fi in their daily work, while up to 25,000 visitors per day, each with their own devices, use the network to make calls, stream videos, and send messages.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1357-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-53125"/><figcaption>Liberty Island Visitors Share their Experience over Indoor and Outdoor Wi-Fi from Cambium Networks &#8211; photo by T. Tolentino</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Foundation works to preserve and honor two of the United States’ greatest landmarks: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. It strives to connect Americans to their heritage and works to foster appreciation for the story of American immigration. The network provides simple, secure access for network users and their guests so they can easily share their visit.</p>



<p>“While visiting the Statue of Liberty and the museum, guests have the ability to share their experiences with friends and families, even in real-time,” said Bruce Miller, vice president of enterprise marketing, Cambium Networks. “Given the lack of internet alternatives on the island, reliability is top priority. Our indoor, outdoor, and high-density Wi-Fi solutions, optimized for latency sensitive applications like voice and video, provide an ideal combination of performance, capacity and flexibility to address the Foundation’s needs.”</p>



<p>“The devices that people bring with them are as diverse as the visitors,” said Scott Imhoff, Senior Vice President of Product Management and Planning, Cambium Networks. “Many visitors do not know that there is no cell service on the island, and the Wi-Fi welcomes them. With <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/xms-cloud/">XMS Cloud Management</a> and <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/easypass-for-xms-managed-networks/">EasyPass</a>, people with laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables are able to easily access the Wi-Fi and have an excellent experience.”</p>



<p>Cambium Networks’ <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/wifi/">2-radio and high density 4-radio access points</a> provide the coverage and capacity needed in the 21,000 square foot state&nbsp;of&nbsp;the art museum, plus&nbsp;outdoor coverage. <a href="https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/software/easypass-for-xms-managed-networks/">EasyPass guest management</a> streamlines and simplifies the end user connection experience and the registration process helps the Foundation keep in touch with its visitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We all live a connected life. Work, school, entertainment, connected smart devices and many more all need a rich wireless experience. Increasing use of video, streaming and AR/VR applications place an ever-increasing demand on bandwidth. These trends have implications for a next-generation campus environment.</p>



<p>So, what is a campus? When you hear the word “campus,” perhaps a university campus comes to mind. However, campus settings span many industries. From corporate campuses to high-density housing and smart cities, campus deployments can vary. However, they all have some common themes that are being fundamentally shaped by user behavior. Users expect an awesome network experience regardless of their location. They are bandwidth hungry. They move around. They gather. High density happens. High density is not just in stadiums and shopping malls anymore. It is everywhere.</p>



<p>There is strong agreement that enterprise network deployments must offer users ease of mobility, multi-building and multi-site coverage, campus security and IoT device connectivity. From the number of ways to achieve that goal, wireless technology provides the multi-gigabit speed needed and can be implemented at a lower total cost.</p>



<p>A next-gen campus must have pervasive coverage and capacity, both indoor and outdoor. It also needs headroom for high density, low latency roaming and secure mobility across the campus. When you look at all these broad sets of requirements, wireless is the answer. Wireless gives you blanket coverage. Wireless enables campus mobility. Wireless gives you flexibility, and wireless is cost-effective.</p>



<p>We see the client explosion happening all around us. Everything is wireless enabled. The number of devices per capita keeps going up. So, we need reliable multi-gigabit connectivity and Wi-Fi to serve these clients. This translates to a unified Wi-Fi switching access network, but 60 GHz backhaul that can provide campus-wide gigabit connectivity. Our end-user experience is tied to how good their applications are performing. So, you also need the ability to deliver end-to-end quality of service for critical applications.</p>



<p>We need a simple management experience across the end-to-end network. Cambium&#8217;s answer to next-gen campus requirements is our end-to-end wireless fabric: multi-gigabit broadband to the edge, The right tool for the right job and right-sized solutions that deliver the lowest cost per megabit. Our answer for management is a common dashboard to visualize the end-to-end network and get actionable insights on client experience with our cloud-first management platform, cnMaestro X. Historically, requirements for outdoor connectivity were rather simplistic: extending the network to the periphery of the building, lighting up a parking lot or perhaps a backup link to connect buildings. Outdoor Wi-Fi access points with Wi-Fi mesh were used in such use cases.</p>



<p>Take 15 minutes to <a href="https://youtu.be/6JVsP9damcU">view my recorded presentation from Cambium Connections</a> to see how indoor and outdoor wireless networks deliver an exceptional network experience with enhanced performance and efficiency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fixed wireless broadband is experiencing a renaissance. With expanding use cases and more demand with the recent pandemic, everyone&#8217;s figuring out how to do everything from home. Over-the-top media has exploded, and industrial automation is becoming more prevalent. Governments around the world are making more spectrum available every day. The supporting standards like 3GPP and 5G NR are utilizing technology that&#8217;s enabling them to become practical.</p>



<p>What does this mean for fixed wireless networks? Ultra-reliable, low-latency communications are important. Sub-one-millisecond latency and super-reliable communications allow for many new use cases to be developed and uses over these networks. Higher data rates, lower latency, increasing density of networks all apply to both fixed and mobile networks. The improved symmetry of a fixed 5G network can allow for new verticals and new use cases. And a private 5G fixed network can be applied as well.</p>



<p>One of the key 5G radio techniques – namely MIMO and multi-user MIMO – apply to fixed wireless. What this means is that fixed wireless now has multiple large numbers of steerable antenna elements. We&#8217;re approaching the radio such that we&#8217;re maximizing the theoretical limits of the amount of data that can be transmitted across that link.</p>



<p>So, why would you consider a 5G fixed solution? There are several reasons. Namely:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Time to market</strong> – The 5G fixed solution from Cambium is simple and has no complex infrastructure. Fiber rollout can take months or years, is time consuming and is only applicable where there&#8217;s enough density to support it.</li><li><strong>Capital and operating expense</strong> &#8211; A 5G fixed solution is much less expensive than that of a 5G mobile solution or even fiber, especially when the density becomes less than that of an urban area.</li><li><strong>Futureproof your investment</strong> &#8211; With a software-defined radio, Cambium Networks’ fixed wireless solutions will easily migrate to the 5G standards when they become available.</li></ul>



<p>Take a few minutes to <a href="https://youtu.be/q7d2CI2gWF0">view my recorded presentation from Cambium Connections</a> to learn more about providing wireless gigabit speeds where fiber and mobile technologies are cost-prohibitive.</p>
